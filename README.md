# FriendSync

FriendSync makes getting your different friend and family circles together easy and stress-free. Start by making your friend groups and adding friends. Then, when you're ready get together, you or any of your friends can press the "Let's Hang Out" button at the top of your friend group's page. All the other members of that group will get a notification with a simple Yes or No. Now, the "Let's Hang Out" button has changed to a "Chat" button and you can coordinate where you'll go and what you'll do. Have fun with your friends!
