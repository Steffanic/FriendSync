# FriendSync

Let's Hang Out! The FriendSync app is designed to help you and your friends, family members, coworkers etc. get together more often! 

For now, you can keep your different circles organized in friend groups. Maybe one for the family, one for work, and one for the besties! And when you want to hang out, just press, "Let's Hang Out!" at the top of whatever group's page you want to get together with. Everyone in that group will get a notification to let them know that you want to hang out and give them a "Yes", "No" option. The rest is up to you! Get the deets settled in the built-in chat room, then get off your phone and out with your friends!

Thank you for checking out the project! Hopefully it will be fully functional in a couple of months! Shooting for late January.
